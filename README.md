# DateComponentsFormatterStandin
Linux's version of Swift's Foundation framework doesn't have DateComponentsFormatter, so this is a very hacky, poorly coded standin.  Not to be used by anyone...

Missing all sorts of API, just translates TimeIntervals into English strings.

Does not format in units longer than days...
